# Simple Todo MVC Application in Plain JavaScript

Learn MVC pattern by building a small app.

- **Model** - Manages the data of an application
- **View** - A visual representation of the model
- **Controller** - Links the user and the system

The app consists of `index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css`. What else do you need?
